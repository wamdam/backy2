# Default block size. 4MB are recommended for backup of Ceph RBD images.
# The block size can be changed on the command line on a version by version basis, but be aware that this will affect
# deduplication and increase the space usage. One possible use case for different block sizes would be backing up LVM
# volumes and Ceph images with the same Backy2 installation. While for Ceph 4MB is usually the best size, LVM volume
# might profit from a smaller block size.

  # Encryption support
  #
  # The identifier is saved together with the object and the corresponding materials
  # are then looked up during decryption. This means that you mustn't change the
  # materials identified by a specific identifier after objects have been encrypted
  # with it. If you want to change the encryption configurarion you must define
  # a new encryption method with a new identifier. If you mark this encryption method
  # as active it will be used to encrypt new objects. Reencrypting old objects is
  # currently not implemented but it wouldn't be a problem to implement proper key
  # rotation.
  #
  # Regarding kdfSalt and kdfIterations:
  # It is highly recommended to generate your own random salt for example with:
  #   dd if=/dev/urandom bs=16 count=1 status=none | base64
  # Don't change the salt and iteration count after writing encrypted objects
  # to the data backend, they cannot be decrypted anymore.
  #
  # Specify either a password, kdfSalt and kdfIteraions or use your
  # own high-entropy-key directly with masterKey in which case the other options
  # are ignored.
